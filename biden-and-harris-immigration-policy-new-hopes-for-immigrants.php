         <span> BIDEN AND HARRIS IMMIGRATION POLICY – NEW HOPES FOR IMMIGRANTS </span>

    <p>Did you know 9 out of 10 immigrants in the United States believe in achieving the American dream? Many migrants come to the U.S because they seek a better and more prosperous life. The Trump administration choked off immigration to America for nearly four years, making it challenging for people to come to the U.S to seek refuge, or to study, work and live.</p>
    <br>

    <p>However, thousands – if not millions – breathed a sigh of relief after Biden and Harris’s victory in the 2020 presidential elections. An overwhelming majority of immigrants are once again hoping to relocate to America to be with their friends and family. Biden's victory offers new hope for immigrants seeking to come and stay in the land of opportunities.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Both Biden and Harris have promised to end Trump's policies on immigration, including the "Remain in Mexico" program. Immigration experts say Biden is committed to untangling President Trump's series of overlapping restrictions. According to the new president-elect, the U.S deserves an immigration policy that reflects the country's highest values.</p>
    <br>

    <p>As president, Joe Biden will pursue immigration policies that safeguard the nation's security and provide a fair system for immigrants to grow and enhance the economy, while securing the country's cherished values.</p>

<p>Moreover, Biden and Harris will make efforts to support the Diversity Visa Lottery Program. The new president has promised to preserve the <a href="">Green Card Lottery</a>, creating more opportunities for people to come to the United States and live the American dream.</p>

<h3>Green Card Lottery</h3>
<p>Statistical data shows that over 740,000 people become American citizens every year. When you become a citizen of the US, you obtain various rights, including the privilege to vote in the state and federal elections. The Diversity Visa program issues 50,000 visas to immigrants every year. The most recent data shows that over 23.2 million people have applied to the Green Card Lottery within the last year, so it’s safe to say it is the most popular immigration program worldwide.</p>
<br>

<p>The average chance of winning the DV lottery, depending on your country of origin, is between 1:25 and 1:75. If you want to live the American dream, it is crucial to apply for the Green Card Lottery as soon as possible. Likewise, if you want to increase your chances of winning the DV Lottery by avoiding application rejection, then consult a Professional Immigration service like the <b>US Green Card Office.</b></p>
<br>

                              </button>

<br>
<p>To date, we have assisted hundreds of thousands of people to win the DV lottery. These people have already received their visas and Green Cards. Some even applied for US Citizenship, got a US Passport, and can by now apply for family members to come to the US, receive citizenship for kids born outside the country, and become eligible for federal scholarships and grants.</p>
<br>

<p>You can also achieve your goals by submitting your application without errors to increase your chances of winning the DV lottery by 65% to become the next US Green Card Winner.</p>
<br>

Our Immigration team will guide you through the entire immigration process, helping you to avoid errors in your application. Remember, most people are disqualified because of the errors they make on their application.

<p>Green Card holders “also known as permanent residents” are people given the authority to live and work in the United States permanently. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) provides proof of this status through a permanent resident card called a green card.</p>


<p>Green Cards earned their nickname because they were colored green between 1946 and 1964. They were made green again in 2010, but the Green Card nickname persisted, even as the cards were colored blue, yellow, and pink.</p>


<p>Today, regardless of their name, permanent U.S. residents aged 18 or older are required always to carry their U.S. Green Card. If you do manage to win the</p>
<p><a href="">Green Card Lottery</a>, the Green Card you get lasts ten years and must be renewed. Green Cards can be renewed online, and it’s simple to do after those ten years have passed. Conditional permanent residents, those who have earned their Green Card through investment or marriage, must renew their Green Card after two years.</p>

<h3>Family-Based Green Cards</h3>

<p>Family sponsorship is among the most common methods for foreign nationals to enter the United States. Green Card holders and American citizens can sponsor certain members of their family for legal status within the United States. The U.S. citizen or Green Card holder sponsoring their relatives must prove that they can financially support the beneficiary.</p>

<p>U.S. citizens and Green Card holders can file immigrant petitions on behalf of their wives, husbands, and unmarried children to gain legal entry for them into United States. U.S. citizens enjoy being able to sponsor wider categories of relatives than Green Card holders. US Citizens can sponsor parents, brothers, sisters, and married children. US Citizens must be over age 21 to sponsor parents, brothers, and sisters.</p>

<p>However, there are still limits to whom a legal citizen is allowed to sponsor. They are not allowed to sponsor aunts, uncles, grandparents, grandchildren, their in-laws, or their cousins—only close relatives and next of kin.</p>

<h3>Employment-Based Green Cards</h3>

<p>Foreign nationals may be able to get a Green Card to stay in the United States if they receive an offer of permanent employment from an employer within the United States and if that employer is willing to sponsor them for a Green Card. Those with higher education and ability are more likely to receive an employment-based Green Card for entry into the United States.</p>

<h3>Investment-Based Green Cards</h3>

<p>Foreign nationals can gain a Green Card for the United States by creating jobs in the country through investing between $500,000 and $1,000,000 in commercial enterprises. The investment must benefit the U.S. economy, and the national in question must have created at least ten full-time jobs for American citizens.</p>

<h3>Refugee/Asylum</h3>

<p>People who are granted asylum or refugee status within the United States are eligible for a Green Card if they meet requirements. They can file an application for an adjustment of status and receive permanent resident status within the U.S. The system might sound daunting, but we are here to help.</p>

            <h2>Latest 12 years of Electronic Diversity Immigrant Visa Program Statistics</h2>

            <p>
            Each year The Kentucky Consular Center in Williamsburg, will notify us about all the selectees of the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. The Green Card Program was conducted under the terms of section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and makes available up to 55,000 permanent resident visas annually to persons from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.
            <br><br>
            Since it is likely that some of the first 55,000 persons registered will not pursue their cases to visa issuance a larger figure will be selected during each fiscal. The following is the statistical breakdown of Selected Entrants for the most recent Diversity Immigrant Visa Programs.

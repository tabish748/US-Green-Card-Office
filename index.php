                              A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa for the United States. The residence card will give you the legal right to study, work, and live permanently in the United States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other benefits. If you are selected to receive a Permanent Residence Card, you can apply for United States Citizenship later if you wish. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship. You and your family could be lucky Green Card holders if you act now and apply for the Green Card Program today

                        <p>The congressional mandated Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (also known as the Green Card Lottery) is administered on an annual basis by the US Department of State and conducted under the terms of Section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Section 131 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-649) amended INA 203 to provide for a new class of immigrants known as “diversity immigrants” (DV immigrants). Alien petitioners for the Diversity Visa Program will no longer be permitted to submit a petition by mail. Instead, the Department will require that all petitions be submitted to it in an electronic format, using an Internet website dedicated specifically to the submission and receipt of Diversity Visa applications. <br><br>
                        US GREEN CARD OFFICE handles the paid value-added service for all Green Card Applicants in 20 different languages, and our fee for this value-added service is $80.00 as a single and $120.00 as a family. The official submission period for the Electronic Diversity Immigrant Visa Program also known as the <a href="# " class="announcemnt-links"> Green Card Lottery</a> is usually 30-60 days, but this can vary from one year to another and is typically between October and November. Our professional immigration team offers you the opportunity to prepare and complete your USA Green Card application online according to all legal requirements 365 days per year, giving you a better time to complete your application and, therefore, a better chance of being selected. Your application will be submitted within the right time as announced by the US Government in the year you apply. When the application has been submitted to the US Government by our immigration team, the official confirmation number will be sent to you as proof that the application has been successfully received and accepted by the US Government. We will keep track of your application status and notify you when the US Government has selected all applicants. We will advise you on how to proceed before attending the Visa Interview in the American embassy, where Immigrant Visas will be issued to the applicants.

                        There are high- and low-admission regions and states. Each nation’s allowance for the American Green Card program depends on the number of Immigrant Visas that the country has issued to foreign citizens within the last five years. This approach ensures migration balance and stimulates diversification.

                        <p>Immigration to America can open many opportunities. If you plan to obtain quality higher education or wish to have access to the best healthcare services, a permanent United States residency is for you. If you want to become a citizen later, your prospects for the future will be even better.
                            <br><br>
                            Students with Green Cards are considered in-state permanent residents of the United States, making American colleges and university tuition fees lower for them than for foreign applicants. Moreover, by winning the Diversity Visa Program, you gain the right to financial aid, which will reduce your study expenses dramatically.
                       <br><br>
                       Green Card holders also qualify for Social Security that grants United States citizens certain privileges. It provides the following benefits:

                        Once you obtain a Green Card via the United States Diversity Visa Program, you will be able to find a better job as well. Permanent residents can build careers in almost any company. Unlike regular immigrants, Green Card holders don’t need sponsorship for work visas from their employers.

                            <p>Your country has qualified to take part in the Electronic Green Card Program thus giving you the opportunity to apply. A Green Card allows you to legally work and reside in the United States permanently! <br/> <span style="display:inline-block;padding-top:10px"> If you are a lucky selectee, it will not only be you personally who will be graded a Green Card. Green Cards will also be issued to your spouse and all children under the age of 21.</span> <br/> <br/> 

                            The program is officially called the Electronic Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (popularly known as the Green Card Program).
                            <br><br>

                            Every year in the US Department of States annual Green Card Program (Diversity Visa Program), between 100,000 and 125,000 applications are selected. Up to 55,000 Green Cards (Permanent Residency Visas) are issued to new immigrants from all over the world.
                            <br><br>
                            The program's objective is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with historically low levels of immigration to the United States.
                            <br><br>
                            The draw will take place through a random computer-generated draw monitored and verified by the US State Department.
